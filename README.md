# ftpSpider
Spiders for a common FTP configuration file used in sublime that can sometimes be mistakenly uploaded.

Inspired by (and largely based on) the [GitTools repo by InternetWache](https://github.com/stolenbikes88/GitTools)

# Status
* Finder will now take a list of domains and output found sftp files
* Extract will extract the ftp details from found files, when given the file generated by finder
